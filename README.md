# Pomobot for Telegram (wip)
`Pomodoro telegram bot` created to test/learn some Golang concepts. All feedback welcome.
##What it can do?
When you start a pomodoro, the bot will send you notifications:
* After 25 minutes of work, a notification to relax for 5
* After 5 minutes relaxing, a notification to work for 25

Answers to:
* /start -> gives you the explanations of each command
* /begin -> starts a new pomodoro
* /pause -> pauses the pomodoro
* /resume -> resumes the pomodoro
* /end -> stops the pomodoro

## Running it
